# Basics of Algorithms and Complexity
A gentle introduction to algorithms and complexity with coded examples.

## What is an algorithm?
In computer science an algorithm is a set of steps or instructions a program takes to complete a task.
Here are some important properties of an algorithm:
* Clearly defined problem statement, input and output.
* The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
* The steps also need to be distinct.
* The algorithm should produce a result.
* The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

There exists numerous algorithms for different purposes; some common algorithms are binary search and sequential search (also known as linear search) used for searching as the name suggests. Another important common algorithm is hashing which is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input data array of a certain type and arbitrary length to an output bit string of a fixed length. Hashing algorithms take any input and convert it to a uniform message by using a hashing table.

A simple implementation of the above mentioned algorithms using python is available in this repository.

## What is complexity?
An algorithm should be efficient and correct, for this matter there exists the concept of complexity which is described using Big-0 notation. Big-O notation is an objective method to evaluate the efficienty and correctness of an algorithm, meaning independent of the hardware.
In the following chart you see the runtimes of common Big-O functions
